![](src/assets/images/about-example2.png)

## Purpose
A portfolio webpage to display who I am, my accomplishments, my resume, and how to contact me.

## Features
When the user loads the site, they view the about me page where lies a blurb about me. On every page there is a  background of me infront of a subtly animated waterfall. The title and navigation of the page is a white block with tranparent text that shows the background instead of solids color.

The portfolio tab displays four of my projects that I have completed. each of them has a small description and a link to the github repo as well as a gif of the website showing some features of that website. The gif also links the user to that deployed project.

The resume page displays my work experience, education, and programs and skills. There is a pdf icon that takes the user to a pdf of my actual resume.

The contact me page displays my email and a form to email me directly with the forms name, email, and message with a send button. There are also buttons for my github and linkedin pages.
